# R375AstroMechSpeechModule

## Overview:
This is just a for-fun project that tries to simulate the voice of R2.
What's special is that it is note just some random sound. If correctly recorded and analyzed, it can be used to regain the original text (idk how yet).


## How to use:
Install these things frist (pip or conda):  `PyTorch`,`transformers`, and `winsound` (Maybe `termcolor`? I haven't cleaned up so you might need to install based on import errors).

#### To use the program, run `python .\main_program.py "The sentence"`

For example: python .\main_program.py "Sir, we are detecting a massive object emerging from hyper space"

Sometimes the droid does not know some words in the sentence, it will call it out in an error and you might need to swtich to a different word.

I used this project as the foundation of sound generation. Modifed for me needs. Also the MIT License is inherited from that project.

This project has many fun features to do the encryption. I am borrowing the "English" to "Binary" portion of it to use it here.

## How it works:
